<br />

## Fixes:
1. AMD Bug - [XDA Thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/fix-fastboot-issues-on-ryzen-based-pcs.4186321/)
2. Switch Device from "Charging" to "File Transfer" Mode
3. Install the latest Device Driver or Universal USB Driver
4. Try another USB Cable
5. Use another USB Port (USB 3.0 Port to USB 2.0)
6. Try to execute Fastboot Command without connecting your Device, and once it says "waiting for device" plug in your USB Cable
7. Windows: Click "Change advanced power setting" on your chosen Plan and expand "USB Settings". Under "USB Settings" Section, expand "USB selective suspend setting" and change it to "Disabled" for On Battery and Plugged In
8. Try another PC
